highest integer? Reasonably, 2^64-1, but you could use bigint of some kind.

highest float? doubles are int53 with an exponent with 11 bits, but you could go higher. However, when making calculations, going above f64 is usually not worth it.
if you want a number near the peak of what a float can handle, that's not recommended, because of higher error margins or smt

a) higher precision floats have more significant digits, so of course there's a loss of precision when adding. It's essentially limited to the precision of
the lower precision float. However, if the exponent of the more precise float is higher than the exponent of the lower precision float, the loss is reduced.

b) multiplication maintains precision.
